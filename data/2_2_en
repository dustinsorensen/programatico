Ben–Right, before going to Thailand we have to make some preparations.
Marina–Yes.
Ben–So, what preparations do we need to make?
Marina–Preparations.
Ben–What preparations do we have to make? Thanks.
Marina–Well, I have to buy sun screen.
Ben–Do you say sun screen or sun cream?
Marina–Both are correct.
Ben–OK, and, well… yes, the sun in Thailand is very strong, so we are going to buy a lot of sun cream.
Marina–Sun Cream.
Ben–Sun Cream.
Marina–And what do you have to buy?
Ben–It’s a problem… this is a big problem, I have to buy summer clothes. I have to buy shorts and T-shirts – terrible!
Marina–And why is that a problem?
Ben–Because I hate buying clothes. I really don’t like buying clothes. It’s a complete pain. What a pain, don’t you think?
Marina–Yes, Ben really doesn’t like buying clothes. I do, I'm going to do some shopping in Thailand.
Ben–Well, in Thailand I’m going to eat a lot and Marina is going to do lots of shopping.
Marina–Just a bit.
Ben–Definitely. Well, what else do we have to do before going to Thailand?
Marina–We have to buy some backpacks.
Ben–Mmmm… a backpack to carry everything that we buy, right?
Marina–Of course. And I have to borrow a sleeping bag.
Ben–Ah! Your friend Isabel is going to lend you a sleeping bag. OK, well, what else, I think that’s everything. Have we got the plane ticket?
Marina–We’ve got the plane tickets and we’ve got the passports.
Ben–Very important.
Marina–We’ve got the most important things.
Ben–Because without a passport we’ll be stuck here in Spain. Which wouldn’t be the end of the world.
Marina–No! Well, we’ve got lots of things to do, but we are going to have a great time in Thailand.

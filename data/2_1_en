Marina–Hi Ben, how are you?
Ben–Hi Marina, I’m fine, how are you?
Marina–Very happy.
Ben–Oh yes, why?
Marina–Because we are going on holiday in Thailand!
Ben–It’s true, we’re going to Thailand, that’s great, isn’t it?
Marina–Uh huh.
Ben–Right, and what are we going to do in Thailand?
Marina–Well, we’re going to Bangkok.
Ben–Bangkok is the capital of Thailand.
Marina–The capital.
Ben–Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, and what are we going to do in Bangkok?
Marina–We are going to see the temples, we’re going to go on a boat trip on the river.
Ben–And the most important thing, I think, is that we’re going to eat a lot of Thai food. Do you like Thai food?
Marina–I really like it.
Ben–I love it. And what else are we going to do in Thailand?
Marina–We’re going to go on a short motorbike trip.
Ben–A motorbike trip in the north of the country, right?
Marina–Through the mountains.
Ben–Fantastic! And what I like best is going to the beach? Are we going to go to the beach?
Marina–Ummm! I think so!
Ben–I hope so.
Marina–Great.
